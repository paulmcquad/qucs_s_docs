Qucs-S includes an extensive range of component, device and circuit modelling tools, allowing it to model and simulate circuits built from standard components and new production devices.

In the years following 2003 the Qucs-S Development team has added a number of additional simulation facilities, including for example, transient simulation, device parameter sweep capabilities and single tone Harmonic Balance simulation, making Qucs-S functionality comparable to SPICE at low frequencies and significantly extended at high frequencies.

Qucs-S releases and to take advantage of the work done by other GPL circuit simulation teams working on the http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/[Ngspice] , https://xyce.sandia.gov/[Xyce] and http://www.spiceopus.si/[SPICE OPUS]  circuit simulators.
