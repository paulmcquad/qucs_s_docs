(((What is Qucs-S?)))

Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program based on http://qucs.github.io/[Qucs] circuit simulator. The "S" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is to use free SPICE circuit simulation kernels with the GUI based on Qt toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI. Qucs-S is not a simulator by itself, but it requires to use an external simulation backend with it. Qucs-S allows to use the following open-source simulation kernels:

*    http://ngspice.org/[Ngspice] is recommended to use. Ngspice is powerful mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator. The most of industrial SPICE models are compatible with Ngspice. It has an excellent performance for time-domain simulation of switching circuits and powerful postprocessor.


*    https://xyce.sandia.gov/[XYCE] is a new SPICE-compatible circuit simulator written by Sandia from the scratch. It supports basic SPICE simulation types and has an advanced RF simulation features such as Harmonic balance simulation.

*    http://spiceopus.si/[SpiceOpus] is developed by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Ljubljana University. It based on the SPICE-3f5 code

*    https://github.com/qucs/qucsator[Qucsator] as backward compatible and for RF and microwave circuits design.
