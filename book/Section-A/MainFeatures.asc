(((Main Features)))

*    Backward compatible with Qucs by the component types and simulations

*    Direct support of SPICE models from components datasheets. SPICE model could be added to schematic without any adaptation.

*    Basic SPICE components: RCL, BJT, MOSFET, JFET, MESFET, switches;
*    Advanced SPICE components: Equation-defined sources and RCLs, transmission lines;
*    Direct support of SPICE Modelcards, SPICE sections (.IC, .NODESET);
*    Parametric circuits (.PARAM) and SPICE postrprocessor (Nutmeg)
*    Basic SPICE simulations: DC, AC, TRAN;
    Advanced SPICE simulation: DISTO, NOISE, SENS (added in 0.0.20), Spectrum analysis;
*    Single-tone and Multitone Harmonic balance analysis with XYCE backend;
*    Nutmeg script simulation: direct access to the SPICE code and construct your own simulation;
*    XYCE script simulation type;
*    XYCE digital devices library;
*    XSPICE CodeModel http://mos-ak.org/lausanne_2017/presentations/T03_Kuznetsov_MOS-AK_DATE_2017.pdf[synthesizer];
*    User mathematical functions definitions with .FUNC;
