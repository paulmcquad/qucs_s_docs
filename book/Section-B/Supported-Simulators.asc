=== Ngspice

http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/download.html[Ngspice] is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator implemented from three open source software packages: SPICE 3f5, Cider 1b1 and XSPICE. Ngspice is one of the most widely used and stable current generation open source SPICE simulators available. Distributed with Ngspice is a data manipulation package called Ngnutmeg. This provides numerical analysis and visualisation routines for post processing Ngspice simulation data. 

*  It implements the original SPICE3f5 simulation capabilities:

* DC, AC, and transient simulation
* Fourier-analysis and sensitivity analysis
* Significant number of extra simulation and device model extensions.

=== Xyce

https://xyce.sandia.gov/Xyce[Xyce] is an open source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analogue circuit simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems when installed on large-scale parallel computing platforms.

=== SPICE OPUS

http://www.spiceopus.si/[SPICE OPUS] is an improved version of SPICE based on the original SPICE 3f5 code with extensions for circuit and device performance optimization and a transient simulation shooting method for large signal steady state AC analysis.

Although Ngspice, Xyce and SPICE OPUS are all compatible SPICE simulators they also include extensions to the original SPICE 3f5 netlist syntax which are often incompatible and may not simulate but generate errors.

The Qucs-S Team is aware of this limitation and are attempting to correct such problems as quickly as possible.
