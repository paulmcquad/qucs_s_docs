=== General simulation methods

The starting point for understanding how the SPICE extensions are built into the Qucs-S GUI is to study the basic operations needed to simulate circuit schematics with external simulators. For this purpose consider the RCL test circuit shown in Figure 2.1.

  An RCL test circuit for demonstrating Ngspice, Xyce and SPICE OPUS simulation controlled from Qucs-S.

This schematic specifies two simulations:

* AC simulation from 1 MHz to 16 MHz.
* Transient simulation from 0 to 1 us;

Simulation->Simulate, or by pressing key F2. After Qucs-S finishes the the AC and transient simulations, plot the output data listed below:

* The voltage across R1 resistor in the frequency domain (given by the voltage at the latexmath:[out] node ),

* The input and output voltage waveforms (the voltages given by the latexmath:[in] and latexmath:[out] nodes): your plots should be similar to those shown in Figure 2.1,

* The current in the frequency domain (latexmath:[Pr1]] current probe )
* The transient current waveform sensed by the current probe latexmath:[Pr1].
