This section describes a number of fundamental methods for launching circuit simulations from the Qucs-S GUI using the http://ngspice.org/[Ngspice], https://xyce.sandia.gov/[XYCE] and http://spiceopus.si/[SpiceOpus] compatible simulator engines.

The http://ngspice.org/[Ngspice], https://xyce.sandia.gov/[XYCE] and http://spiceopus.si/[SpiceOpus] simulators are not embedded in Qucs-S but operate as independent external simulators. Before use they must be installed on the computer operating system that you are running Qucs-S.

Although http://ngspice.org/[Ngspice], https://xyce.sandia.gov/[XYCE] and http://spiceopus.si/[SpiceOpus] are all compatible SPICE
simulators they also include extensions to the original SPICE 3f5
netlist syntax which are often incompatible and may not simulate on each
of the three external simulators. 

The Qucs-S Development Team are aware of this limitation and are attempting to identify and correct such problems as quickly as possible. Please note this may take some time. However, if you do identify a compatibility bug, or indeed any bug,
please inform us by sending in a bug report to the Qucs-S web site (with
an example test schematic if possible) describing the problem you have
identified.
