This section describes a number of fundamental methods for launching circuit simulations from the Qucs-S GUI using the Ngspice, Xyce and SPICE OPUS compatible simulator engines.

The Ngspice, Xyce and SPICE OPUS simulators are not embedded in Qucs but operate as independent external simulators. Before use they must be installed on the computer operating system that you are running Qucs-S.
